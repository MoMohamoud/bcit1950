					<p> Our website provides COMP 1950 students with all the online information that they require
					throughout the course explained in a simple, ordered and sensible format.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The website is simple in the way that it provides course information, 
					lectures, exercises,quizzes, emails and resources through a simple menu located on the left side of the page.  
					the choice of the design of the webpage i.e. fixed header, side bars and footer will
					ensure an ease in transfer between the displayed content and any other desired option like lectures, assignments, quizzes, curriculum, etc. 
						</li>
						 <li>The site contains all information on the progress of the course and the student achievement as well providing a form of interactivity between students using chat and sending question about the lecture.
						</li>	
						<li>Students can get the timetable, room information, grading, and notification directly when they log in to the site. 
						</li>
						<li>In addition, they can display or download all exercises and  homework specifications from one location
					instead of scattering them throughout each separate lecture page. Each up to date lecture can be accessed from a 
					dropdown menu when they click on the lecture option in the sidebar menu. When a lecture is selected, the lecture 
					will be displayed in an accordion format to save space on the page and provide the students with structured lecture which can easily accessed.
						</li>
						<li>The instructor can easily update or add new lecture, change the curriculum and add more
					examples or exercises.
						</li>
                        							
					</ul>
